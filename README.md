## The Daily Plan

**Each day take one subject from the list below, watch videos about that subject, and write an implementation in:**
- C - using structs and functions that take a struct * and something else as args.
- C++ - without using built-in types
- C++ - using built-in types, like STL's std::list for a linked list
- Python - using built-in types (to keep practicing Python)
- and write tests to ensure you're doing it right, sometimes just using simple assert() statements

Why code in all of these?
- Practice, practice, practice, until you're sick of it, and can do it with no problem
- Work within the raw constraints (allocating/freeing memory without help of garbage collection (except Python))
- Make use of built-in types so I have experience using the built-in tools for real-world use (not going to write my own linked list implementation in production)

You can see my code here:
 - [C](https://github.com/jwasham/practice-c)
 - [C++](https://github.com/jwasham/practice-cpp)
 - [Python](https://github.com/jwasham/practice-python)

Write code on a whiteboard or paper, not a computer. Test with some sample inputs. Then test it out on a computer.
